# 555 Timer Calculator

A web-based tool to calculate and simulate 555 timer circuit values. This project allows users to easily determine resistor and capacitor values based on input frequency, amplitude, and mode of operation (Astable, Bistable, Monostable) for accurate 555 timer circuit design.

## Features

- **Frequency Input**: Users can input frequency in Hz, mHz, kHz, or MHz.
- **Amplitude Input**: Set amplitude in V or mV.
- **Mode of Operation**: Choose between Astable, Bistable, or Monostable mode for the timer.
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Provides real-time feedback with calculated resistor and capacitor values.
- **Visual Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with a responsive design.

## Installation

To use the project locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhammed-Dilshad/555-Timer-Calculator.git
cd 555-Timer-Calculator
open index.html
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles logic for frequency and amplitude calculations.

## How It Works

1. Input the **frequency** in the provided input box, selecting the appropriate unit.
2. Select the **mode of operation** (Astable, Bistable, or Monostable).
3. Enter the **amplitude** and select the unit (V or mV).
4. Click "Submit" to calculate the resistor and capacitor values for the 555 timer circuit.
5. View the results and circuit image in the popup.
